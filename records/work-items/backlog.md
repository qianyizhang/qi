# Backlog

This page owns the backlog lifecycle and schema. It does not duplicate item
status. Every active or not-yet-archived item is one durable file under
`records/work-items/items/`; terminal items follow the retention and closeout
rules in `docs/rules/doc.md`.

## Triage Tags

- `[MVP]`: needed before the current slice is trustworthy.
- `[domain]`: bounded-context or shared-kernel implementation work.
- `[frontend]`: app/API/user-surface work.
- `[hygiene]`: doc/tooling cleanup that protects the SSOT.

## Work Status

- `deferred`: valid work, deliberately not scheduled.
- `ready`: scope and acceptance criteria are sufficient to begin.
- `wip`: actively owned; implementation has started.
- `blocked`: needs a named decision, dependency, or capability.
- `done`: all acceptance criteria are satisfied and verified.
- `partial`: terminal accepted subset; remaining scope exists as linked items.
- `canceled`: terminal intentional abandonment, with rationale.

`partial` never becomes `done`. Close the residual scope through new items linked
with `residual_of` / `residual_items`; the original outcome remains historical.

Canonical `work_kind` values are `decision`, `build`, and `research`.

## Intent

## Acceptance Criteria

## Context and Trade-offs

## Status History

| Date | Actor | From | To | Reason / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | <actor> | — | deferred | Item captured |

## Implementation Ledger

No implementation events yet.
```

Status History is terse and append-only. Implementation Ledger entries are
substantive and use one of `finding`, `decision`, `assumption`, `deviation`,
`verification`, or `handoff`; each records evidence, consequence, follow-up, and
review state (`not-required`, `pending`, `ratified`, `rejected`, `superseded`, or
`audit-requested`).

At closeout, retain the outcome, acceptance evidence, residual links, required
headings, and status history while an item remains addressable. Trim duplicated
specification and spent execution prose after preserving durable meaning in its
owner. Preserve decisions, failures, corrections, and any explicitly append-only
evidence history. Do not delete or relocate an item still needed by ID references,
catalog discovery, or provenance. Routine progress needs no new ledger entry when
an execution artifact already records it.

## Discovery

```bash
find records/work-items/items -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' -print | sort
rg -n '^work_status: (ready|wip|blocked)$' records/work-items/items
rg -n '^[-*] \*\*Review:\*\* (pending|audit-requested)$' records/work-items/items
```
