# Backlog

This page owns the backlog lifecycle and schema. It does not duplicate item
status. Every active or not-yet-archived item is one durable file under
`records/work-items/items/`; terminal items pass through the repository's
promotion and archive lifecycle.

## Triage Tags

- `[MVP]`: needed before the current slice is trustworthy.
- `[domain]`: bounded-context or shared-kernel implementation work.
- `[frontend]`: app/API/user-surface work.
- `[hygiene]`: doc/tooling cleanup that protects the SSOT.

## Work Status

- `deferred`: valid work, deliberately not scheduled.
- `ready`: scope and acceptance criteria are sufficient to begin.
- `wip`: actively owned; implementation has started.
- `blocked`: needs a named decision, dependency, or capability.
- `done`: all acceptance criteria are satisfied and verified.
- `partial`: terminal accepted subset; remaining scope exists as linked items.
- `canceled`: terminal intentional abandonment, with rationale.

`partial` never becomes `done`. Close the residual scope through new items linked
with `residual_of` / `residual_items`; the original outcome remains historical.

Canonical `work_kind` values are `decision`, `build`, and `research`.

## Intent

## Acceptance Criteria

## Context and Trade-offs

## Status History

| Date | Actor | From | To | Reason / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | <actor> | — | deferred | Item captured |

## Implementation Ledger

No implementation events yet.
```

Status History is terse and append-only. Implementation Ledger entries are
substantive and use one of `finding`, `decision`, `assumption`, `deviation`,
`verification`, or `handoff`; each records evidence, consequence, follow-up, and
review state (`not-required`, `pending`, `ratified`, `rejected`, `superseded`, or
`audit-requested`).

## Discovery

```bash
find records/work-items/items -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' -print | sort
rg -n '^work_status: (ready|wip|blocked)$' records/work-items/items
rg -n '^[-*] \*\*Review:\*\* (pending|audit-requested)$' records/work-items/items
```
